1. Chi - A project created for my grade 11 math IA, uses chi square to crack simple ciphers like caesar cipher and vigenere cipher (vigenere is currently hard coded to key length up to 4, not memory efficient and will likely fail at key length > 6? due to brute force methodology, algorithm only filters potentially useful from the noise)
